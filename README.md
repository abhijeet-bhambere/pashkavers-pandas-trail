- Various ways to handle
  - NaN/missing values
  - change of column dtypes
- Basic ways to filter data from Dataframes based on conditions & best ways to optimize them in a filetring query

### â­• Coming up next:
- Modifying a DataFrames -- either entire column or row or a specific value.
- Various string methods 
- Multi-indexing
- Groupby, Merging, Aggregating
- Wrking with Dates & Times
- Exporting results

- Additional options & setting in pandas

### ðŸš§ Further projects that reflect more real-world application will follow in this or separate repo as part of further learning.
