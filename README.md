### I created this repo to track the progress on a udemy course for pandas.<br>
#### Intent is to keep it updated regularly as I build up solid understanding of the basics of exploratory data analysis using pandas & other relevant libraries.

#### ✅ Topics covered so far
- Covering basics of loading a dataset into pandas, mostly csv files with the <code>read_csv</code> method.
- Various ways to handle
  - NaN/missing values
  - change of column dtypes
- Basic ways to filter data from Dataframes based on conditions & best ways to optimize them in a filetring query
- Modifying a DataFrames -- either entire column or row or a specific value.
- Various string methods 
- Multi-indexing
  
### ⭕ Coming up next:
- Groupby, Merging, Aggregating
- Wrking with Dates & Times
- Exporting results
- Data visualizations
- Additional options & setting in pandas

### 🚧 Projects that reflect more real-world applications & overall end-to-end processes will follow this as part of further learning.
